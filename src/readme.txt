== Description ==

Render is a powerful plugin which enables you to insert useful and powerful functionality into your content. All without writing or even seeing any code.

Render is powered by WordPress shortcodes but, unlike all other shortcode plugins, shortcodes created by Render offer a live preview within your content so you can see how each feature looks before you hit publish and without having to use or learn the standard shortcode syntax.

Some of the shortcodes included are:

Button
Columns
Login form
Custom query
Conditional content display
User meta
Site details
Post meta
Current date/time
And more!

== Installation ==

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the `render` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. View available shortcodes by going to Shortcodes in the admin menu
